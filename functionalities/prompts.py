2. Structure: Acceptance criteria must follow one of the two formats: Given/When/Then or Rule-Based. If the acceptance criteria is in Given/When/Then format, evaluate the acceptance criteria based on the presence and content of - * Precondition * User Action * Outcome/Results of the action. * If the acceptance criteria is in rule-based format, evaluate the acceptance criteria based on - * Clarity and specificity of the rule that story must satisfy Outcome/results of the action. 
3. Relevance: How relevant the criteria are to the user story. Acceptance criteria should not contain- * "TBD" or "NA" or "Not Applicable" (additional values beside the above) Definition of Done * Copy of another story/bug * Outside External documents * Attachments 
4. Testability: How easy it is to write test cases for the criteria, * Ease with which the acceptance criteria can be translated into test cases Should not refer phrases which verifiable E.g. "Morks as designed" "As expected", "Functions Successfully", "Testing is completed" "A11 my test cases have passed", it should explain the how are not part, " If the acceptance criteria belongs to Performance Test, then Acceptance criteria should use metrics that are measurable and specific to application with expected outcomes.
